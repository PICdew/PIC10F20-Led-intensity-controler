# Led intensity controler for IKEA JANSJÖ using PIC 10F200

This project is for improving the IKEA JANSJÖ led light with power control. Includes both software and hardware design.

I have build myself the circuit using a prototyping board of 15 x 4 tenths of an inch, that fits inside the original lamp switch.

It consist of two push-buttons, one for increasing power, and another for decreasing. Pressing the two buttons at the same time switches on and off the ligth. (On switch on, recovers the previous power setting)

The design can be adapted for use in other similar applications. Be aware on the voltage and current of the device.

**WARNING!** There are two kinds of power suppliers for led lamps: Voltages sources and Current sources. This design is *ONLY* meant for the Voltage sources.
